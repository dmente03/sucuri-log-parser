# sucuri-log-parser
The application Log Parser lists the total number of entries found in the log file, how many of them were 
errors or success (based on the HTTP return code), what files were visited more often and the most popular referers (and their %'s too).

Also lists the top user agents (and their %'s) and malicious requests.
